Tips:(For the sake of encoding,English is used here ^_^)

1.This directory includes source files(psex.c,and kernel module source files in ./kmod),
	all the binary files under the directory ./bin.
2.The encoding of all source files and head files are UTF-8
3.In order to run program,you must set you local to zh_CN.UTF-8,
  (This could be done by add following line to your .bashrc,and relogin)
	export LANG = zh_CN.UTF-8
4.You'd better recompile all the source file(by typing make under shell),
	those source are compile and testing under Ubuntu Server 10.04 amd64 LTS
5.After compile simply type ./psex.sh to exute testing program.
6.The Last thing,please forgive me for my poor English.

Good luck!
